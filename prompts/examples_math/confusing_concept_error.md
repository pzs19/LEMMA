#### Example 1

[Question]:
Consider the lines \begin{align*}
y&=3x+5 \\ 2y&=4x+5 \\ 3y&=9x-2 \\ 2y&=x-3 \\ 4y&=x-5.
\end{align*}Let's say that a pair of lines is $\emph{good}$ if the two lines are either parallel or perpendicular to each other.  Among all the pairs of lines shown, how many pairs are good?

[Ground-truth Solution]:
We find the slope for each line. The slopes are $\frac31=3$, $\frac42=2$, $\frac93=3$, $\frac12$, and $\frac14$.
Parallel lines have the same slope, therefore lines $a$ and $c$ are parallel. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals. None of the slopes above are negative reciprocals, therefore there are no perpendicular lines. There are $1+0=\boxed{1}$ pairs of lines that are parallel or perpendicular.

[Error-Injected Solution]:
Let's think step by step
The slopes of the lines are 3, 2, 3, 1/2, and 1/4.
The lines $y=3x+5$ and $3y=9x-2$ have the same slope, so they are parallel.
The lines $y=3x+5$ and $2y=x-3$ are perpendicular with slopes 3 and 1/2.
The lines $2y=4x+5$ and $3y=9x-2$ are parallel, as are the lines $2y=4x+5$ and $4y=x-5$.
So, the answer is 6.
The answer is: 6
<explanation>
The error in this solution is a 'confusing_concept_error'. The proposed solution incorrectly identifies the lines $2y=4x+5$ and $3y=9x-2$ as parallel, and the lines $2y=4x+5$ and $4y=x-5$ as parallel. The slopes of the lines $2y=4x+5$ and $3y=9x-2$ are 2 and 3, respectively, which are not the same, so they are not parallel. The slopes of the lines $2y=4x+5$ and $4y=x-5$ are 2 and 1/4, respectively, which are not the same, so they are not parallel.

#### Example 2

[Question]:
Suppose $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\gcd(a,b)$ is divisible by exactly $7$ distinct primes and $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is divisible by exactly $28$ distinct primes.

If $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, then $a$ has at most how many distinct prime factors?

[Ground-truth Solution]:
The prime factors of $\gcd(a,b)$ are precisely the prime factors which are common to $a$ and $b$ (i.e., the primes that divide both). The prime factors of $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ are the primes which divide at least one of $a$ and $b$.

Thus, there are $7$ primes which divide both $a$ and $b$, and $28-7=21$ more primes which divide exactly one of $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, we know that fewer than half of these $21$ primes divide $a$; at most, $10$ of these primes divide $a$. So, $a$ has at most $7+10=\boxed{17}$ distinct prime factors.

[Error-Injected Solution]:
Let's think step by step
The product of $a$ and $b$ is equal to the product of $\gcd(a,b)$ and $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]$.
Therefore, the product of the distinct prime factors of $a$ and $b$ is equal to the product of the distinct prime factors of $\gcd(a,b)$ and $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]$,
which is $7 \cdot 28 = 196 = 2^2 \cdot 7^2$.
Let $a$ have $x$ factors and $b$ have $y$ factors.
The number of distinct prime factors of $a$ is at most $x$,
and the number of distinct prime factors of $b$ is at most $y$.
Thus, the product of the distinct prime factors of $a$ and $b$ is at most $x \cdot y$.
Since the product is $196$, we have $x \cdot y = 196$.
The only possible choices are $x = 1$ and $y = 196$, $x = 2$ and $y = 98$,
$x = 4$ and $y = 49$, $x = 7$ and $y = 28$, and $x = 14$ and $y = 14$.
Since $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$,
the only possible choice is $x = 4$.
Therefore, $a$ is at most $\boxed{4}$ distinct prime factors.
The answer is: 4

I inject a 'confusing_concept_error' into the solution. The proposed solution incorrectly assumes that the product of the distinct prime factors of $a$ and $b$ is equal to the product of the distinct prime factors of $\gcd(a,b)$ and $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]$, which is $7 \cdot 28 = 196 = 2^2 \cdot 7^2$. The correct approach is to consider the prime factors of $\gcd(a,b)$ and $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ separately, and then combine the results to find the number of distinct prime factors of $a$ and $b$.

#### Example 3

[Question]:
Find the matrix $\mathbf{M}$ that doubles the first column of a matrix.  In other words,
\[\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2a & b \\ 2c & d \end{pmatrix}.\]If no such matrix $\mathbf{M}$ exists, then enter the zero matrix.

[Ground-truth Solution]:
Let $\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix}.$  Then
\[\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} pa + qc & pb + qd \\ ra + sc & rb + sd \end{pmatrix}.\]We want this to be equal to $\begin{pmatrix} 2a & b \\ 2c & d \end{pmatrix}.$  There are no constants $p,$ $q,$ $r,$ $s$ that will make this work, so the answer is the zero matrix $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}.$

[Error-Injected Solution]:
Let's think step by step
We need to find a matrix $\mathbf{M}$ such that
\[\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2a & b \\ 2c & d \end{pmatrix}.\]This means that $\mathbf{M}$ must satisfy
\[\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\]for the first column.
This implies that $\mathbf{M} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}$.
The answer is: \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
<explanation>
I inject a 'confusing_concept_error' into the solution. The first wrong step arises because the proposed solution incorrectly assumes that the matrix $\mathbf{M}$ can be determined by only considering its effect on the first column of the identity matrix. This approach fails to account for the requirement that $\mathbf{M}$ must also correctly transform the second column.
