#### Example 1

[Question]:
Each face of a cube is painted either  red or blue, each with probability 1/2. The color of each face is determined independently.  What is the probability that the painted cube can be placed on a horizontal surface so that the four vertical faces are all the same color?

[Ground-truth Solution]:
If the orientation of the cube is fixed, there are $2^6 = 64$ possible arrangements of colors on the faces. There are \[
2\binom{6}{6}=2
\]arrangements in which all six faces are the same color and \[
2\binom{6}{5}=12
\]arrangements in which exactly five faces have the same color. In each of these cases the cube can be placed so that the four vertical faces have the same color. The only other suitable arrangements have four faces of one color, with the other color on a pair of opposing faces. Since there are three pairs of opposing faces, there are $2(3)=6$ such arrangements. The total number of suitable arrangements is therefore $2+12+6=20$, and the probability is $20/64= \boxed{\frac{5}{16}}$.

[Error-Injected Solution]:
Let's think step by step
There are $2^6 = 64$ ways to paint the cube.
If four vertical faces are all the same color, the other two vertical faces must be the same color, too.
There are 2 choices for this common color, and 2 choices for the color of the other two faces.  Thus, there are $2 \times 2 = 4$ ways to paint the cube so that four vertical faces are the same color.
Therefore, the probability that the cube can be placed so that the four vertical faces are the same color is $\frac{4}{64}=\boxed{\frac{1}{16}}$.
The answer is: 1/16
<explanation>
The error in this solution is a 'missing_step'. The proposed solution only considers the case where the four vertical faces are the same color and the other two faces are also the same color, but it misses other valid configurations where the four vertical faces are the same color but the other two faces are different.

#### Example 2

[Question]:
A pet store has 15 puppies, 6 kittens, and 8 hamsters. Alice, Bob, and Charlie each want to buy a pet. For variety, they each want a different kind of pet. How many ways can Alice, Bob, and Charlie buy pets and leave the store satisfied?

[Ground-truth Solution]:
Ignoring who gets which pet for now, we can see that there are $15 \cdot 6 \cdot 8$ ways to choose one puppy, one kitten, and one hamster. Now, Alice has three choices for which type of pet she wants, Bob has two, and Charlie has one, due to the constraint that they must each have a different type of pet. Thus, there are $15 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = \boxed{4320}$ such ways.

[Error-Injected Solution]:
Let's think step by step
Alice has 3 choices for types of pets.
After Alice has made her selection, Bob has 2 choices, and Charlie has 1 choice.
Hence, there are $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = \boxed{6}$ ways to pick the types of pets the children will buy.
The answer is: 6
<explanation>
I inject a 'missing_step' into the solution. The first wrong step arises because the proposed solution only considers the permutations of the types of pets the children can choose, but it does not account for the number of ways to choose the specific pets of each type.

#### Example 3


[Question]:
If I have a $4\times 4$ chess board, in how many ways can I place four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row of the board contains no more than one pawn?

[Ground-truth Solution]:
Because our chess board is $4 \times 4$, there must be exactly one pawn in each column and each row. Consider the ways to place one pawn in each row. In the first row, there are four potential spots for a pawn. However, no matter where we place the pawn, it takes up one column. So, in the second row, there are only three potential spots for a pawn. Similarly, there are two spots in the third row and only one in the fourth. Thus, there are $4\cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24$ ways in which we can place the pawns. Now, because each pawn is distinct, we have four possible pawns to place in the first slot, three in the second, two in the fourth, and one in the last. So there are $24$ possible orderings of the pawns. Our final answer is thus $24^2 = \boxed{576}$.

[Error-Injected Solution]:
Let's think step by step
There are four possible places for the first pawn, $P_1.$  Then there are three possible places for the second pawn,
$P_2.$  The third pawn, $P_3,$ has only two possible places, and the last pawn has only one possible place.
Thus, we can place the pawns $P_1, P_2, P_3,$ and $P_4$ in $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = \boxed{24}$ ways.
The answer is: 24
<explanation>
I inject a 'missing_step' into the solution. The solution only considers the placement of the pawns without accounting for the fact that each pawn is distinct and can be arranged in different orders.
