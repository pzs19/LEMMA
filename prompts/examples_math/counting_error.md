#### Example 1

[Question]:
One of the following 8 figures is randomly chosen. What is the probability that the chosen figure is a triangle? [asy]
size(8cm);
path tri = (0, 0)--(1, 0)--(0.5, Sin(60))--cycle;
path circ = shift((0.5, 0.5)) * (scale(0.5) * unitcircle);
path sq = unitsquare;
pair sf = (1.9, 0); // Shift factor

draw(sq); draw(shift(sf) * tri); draw(shift(2 * sf) * circ); draw(shift(3 * sf) * tri);

draw(shift(4 * sf) * sq); draw(shift(5 * sf) * circ); draw(shift(6 * sf) * tri); draw(shift(7 * sf) * sq);
[/asy]

[Ground-truth Solution]:
There are 8 figures in total. Of these, 3 are triangles. Therefore, the probability is $\boxed{\frac38}$.

[Error-Injected Solution]:
Let's think step by step
There are $\boxed{4}$ triangles and $\boxed{4}$ shapes
that are not triangles,
so the probability that a randomly chosen shape is a triangle is $\frac{4}{4+4} = \frac{1}{2}.$
The answer is: \frac{1}{2}

<explanation>
The error in this solution is a 'counting_error'. The number of triangles was counted incorrectly. There are actually 3 triangles, not 4. Therefore, the wrong type is 'counting_error'.

#### Example 2

[Question]:
Each of the ten letters in ``MATHCOUNTS'' is written on its own square tile and placed in a bag. What is the probability that a tile randomly selected from the bag will have a letter on it that is in the word ``TEACH''? Express your answer as a common fraction.

[Ground-truth Solution]:
Among the 10 letters in the word MATHCOUNTS, the 5 letters, A, T, H, C, and T appear in the word TEACH.  The probability of drawing one of these tiles is $\dfrac{5}{10}=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

[Error-Injected Solution]:
Let's think step by step
The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.
There are 10 tiles, so there are 10 total outcomes.
There are 3 tiles that have a letter that is in the word ``TEACH'' (T, E, A), so there are 3 favorable outcomes.
Therefore, the probability is $\frac{3}{10}$.
The answer is: \frac{3}{10} 

<explanation>
I inject a 'counting_error' into the solution. The number of favorable outcomes was miscalculated. The word "TEACH" contains the letters T, E, A, C, and H. In "MATHCOUNTS," the letters T, A, H, C, and T are present, which means there are 5 favorable outcomes, not 3. Therefore, the wrong type is 'counting_error'. The correct probability should be $\frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}$. The answer is \frac{1}{2}.
