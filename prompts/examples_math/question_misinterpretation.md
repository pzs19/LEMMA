#### Example 1

[Question]:
If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits and $0.abc$ can be expressed as $\frac{1}{y}$ where $y$ is an integer such that $0<y\le9$, then what is the largest possible value of $a+b+c$?

[Ground-truth Solution]:
Converting from a decimal to a fraction, we obtain $0.abc = \frac{abc}{1000} = \frac{abc}{2^3\cdot5^3} = \frac{1}{y}$. Since $0<y\le9$ and $y$ divides into $1000$, $y$ must equal one of $1,2,4,5$ or $8$. Notice that $y\neq1$ because then $abc = 1000$, which is impossible as $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits. So, breaking down the remaining possibilities: \begin{align*}
y&=2 \Rightarrow abc = 2^2\cdot5^3 = 500 \Rightarrow a+b+c = 5+0+0=5 \\
y&=4 \Rightarrow abc = 2\cdot5^3 = 250 \Rightarrow a+b+c = 2+5+0=7 \\
y&=5 \Rightarrow abc = 2^3\cdot5^2 = 200 \Rightarrow a+b+c = 2+0+0 = 2 \\
y&=8 \Rightarrow abc = 5^3 = 125 \Rightarrow a+b+c =1+2+5 = 8.
\end{align*}Therefore, the largest possible value of $a+b+c$ is $\boxed{8}$.

[Error-Injected Solution]:
Let's think step by step
The only single-digit $b$ that works in this problem is $b = 1,$
since $0.abc$ is always less than $1.$
Then $y = 9 \cdot 10^c.$
We need $y \le 9,$ so $c = 0,$ which means $a = 1.$
Then $a + b + c = \boxed{2}.$
The answer is: 2
<explanation>
The error in this solution is a 'question_misinterpretation' error. The problem's constraints and the nature of the fraction $\frac{1}{y}$ were misunderstood. The proposed solution incorrectly assumes that $b = 1$ and $y = 9 \cdot 10^c$, which does not align with the requirement that $0.abc = \frac{1}{y}$ where $y$ is an integer between 1 and 9.

#### Example 2
[Question]:
License plates from different states follow different alpha-numeric formats, which dictate which characters of a plate must be letters and which must be numbers. Florida has license plates with an alpha-numeric format like the one pictured. North Dakota, on the other hand, has a different format, also pictured. Assuming all 10 digits are equally likely to appear in the numeric positions, and all 26 letters are equally likely to appear in the alpha positions, how many more license plates can Florida issue than North Dakota?

[Ground-truth Solution]:
Florida issues license plates in which the first three and last slots are filled with letters, and the fourth and fifth are filled with digits. Thus, there are $26^4 \cdot 10^2$ Florida license plates possible. North Dakota, however, issues license plates in which the first three slots are filled with letters and the last three slots are filled with digits. There are thus $26^3 \cdot 10^3$ possible North Dakota license plates. Multiplying these out and taking the difference yields an answer of $\boxed{28121600}$.

[Error-Injected Solution]:
Let's think step by step
Florida license plates have 7 characters, of which two are letters and five are digits.
So the number of license plates Florida can issue is
$$
\binom{7}{2}10^2 26^5 = 18,811,700,384,000.
$$
North Dakota license plates have 8 characters, of which three are letters and five are digits.
So the number of license plates North Dakota can issue is
$$
\binom{8}{3}10^5 26^3 = 10,015,636,800,000.
$$
Therefore, Florida can issue $\boxed{15,798,037}$ more license plates than North Dakota.
The answer is: 15,798,037
<explanation>
I inject a 'question_misinterpretation' error into the solution. The the format of the license plates for Florida and North Dakota was misunderstood. Florida's plates have 5 characters, with the first three and the last one being letters and the fourth and fifth being digits. North Dakota's plates also have 5 characters, with the first three being letters and the last two being digits. The proposed solution incorrectly uses 7 and 8 characters, respectively, and applies incorrect combinatorial formulas.

#### Example 3

[Question]:
Consider all polynomials of the form
\[x^9 + a_8 x^8 + a_7 x^7 + \dots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0,\]where $a_i \in \{0,1\}$ for all $0 \le i \le 8.$  Find the number of such polynomials that have exactly two different integer roots.

[Ground-truth Solution]:
If all the $a_i$ are equal to 0, then the polynomial becomes $x^9 = 0,$ which has only one integer root, namely $x = 0.$  Thus, we can assume that there is some coefficient $a_i$ that is non-zero.  Let $k$ be the smallest integer such that $a_k \neq 0$; then we can take out a factor of $x^k,$ to get
\[x^k (x^{9 - k} + a_8 x^{8 - k} + a_7 x^{7 - k} + \dots + a_{k + 1} x + a_k) = 0.\]By the Integer Root Theorem, any integer root of $x^{9 - k} + a_8 x^{8 - k} + \dots + a_{k + 1} x + a_k = 0$ must divide $a_k = 1,$ so the only possible integer roots are 1 and $-1.$ However, if we plug in $x = 1,$ we see that $x^{9 - k} = 1,$ and all the other terms are nonnegative, so $x = 1$ cannot be a root.

Therefore, for the original polynomial to have two different integer roots, they must be 0 and $-1.$  For 0 to be a root, it suffices to take $a_0 = 0,$ and the polynomial is
\[x^9 + a_8 x^8 + a_7 x^7 + a_6 x^6 + a_5 x^5 + a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x = 0.\]We also want $x = -1$ to be a root.  We have that $(-1)^9 = -1,$ so in order for the polynomial to become 0 at $x = -1,$ we must choose some of the $a_i$ to be equal to 1.  Specifically, if $k$ is the number of $i$ such that $a_i = 1$ and $i$ is odd, then the number of $i$ such that $a_i = 1$ and $i$ is even must be $k + 1.$

There are four indices that are odd (1, 3, 5, 7), and four indices that are even (2, 4, 6, 8), so the possible values of $k$ are 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Furthermore, for each $k,$ so the number of ways to choose $k$ odd indices and $k + 1$ even indices is $\binom{4}{k} \binom{4}{k + 1}.$  Therefore, the number of such polynomials is
\[\binom{4}{0} \binom{4}{1} + \binom{4}{1} \binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{2} \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \binom{4}{4} = \boxed{56}.\]

[Error-Injected Solution]:
Let's think step by step
If there are two integer roots, then there are at most six other nonzero coefficients,
corresponding to the factorization $x(x-1)(x+1)(x-t_1)(x-t_2)\dots(x-t_6).$
There are no other integer roots, so $|t_1|, |t_2|, |t_3| \ge 2.$
Thus, there are no more than ${6 \choose 2}=15$ possible polynomials.
On the other hand, we can construct $15$ polynomials of this form.
For example, we can let the coefficients be the binary representations of the first $15$ positive integers.
Thus, we can conclude that there are $\boxed{15}$ polynomials of this type.
The answer is: 15
<explanation>
I inject a 'question_misinterpretation' error into the solution. The first wrong step arises because the proposed solution incorrectly assumes that the polynomial must have the factorization form \(x(x-1)(x+1)(x-t_1)(x-t_2)\dots(x-t_6)\) with \(|t_1|, |t_2|, |t_3| \ge 2\). This assumption is incorrect because the problem specifies that the coefficients \(a_i\) can only be 0 or 1, and the polynomial must have exactly two different integer roots, which are 0 and -1. The correct factorization should be \(x(x+1)\) with the remaining coefficients chosen such that the polynomial remains a polynomial with coefficients in \(\{0,1\}\).
