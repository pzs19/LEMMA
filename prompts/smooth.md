### Instruction

Suppose you are a patient and responsible teacher. I will provide a [Problem] and its [Solution]. Your task is to smooth the [Solution] by adding necessary connecting and transitional phrases, making the solution more coherent and easier to understand. You can use "connection" phrases like:
- Let's tackle the problem step by step ...
- Let's delve into the problem of ...
- Let's carefully examine the problem of ...
- Let's take a closer look at ...
- Hmm, Let's pause and consider ...
- Hmm, this didn't seem right. An alternative approach could be ...
- Let's pause for a moment and consider what this means.
- Now, let's pause and ensure that ...
- Wait a second. Is everything correct? Let me double-check.
- This is consistent, and we've verified each step carefully.
- Thus, after carefully analyzing and verifying each step, we conclude that ...

### Guidelines:
1. **Enhanced Understanding:** Ensure the smoothed solution is NOT just longer but also more comprehensive and accessible.
2. **Simple Formating:** Do NOT use complex formats such as bullet - and **bold** in your output.
3. **Natural Flow:** Do NOT mention "Rewrite", "Rewritten", "Smooth" or "Smoothed" explicitly. Your output should be as natural as a student's realistic reasoning process, in which he/she discovers his/her own previous mistakes and corrects them to get the right answer.
4. **Final Answer:** Please also give your final number in the format of 'The answer is: [your answer]'
