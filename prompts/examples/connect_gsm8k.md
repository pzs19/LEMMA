#### Example 1

[Question]
Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet? Please also give your final number in the format of 'The answer is [your answer]'

[Previous Attempt]
Betty needed 100 dollars for the wallet. She had half of that, or 100 / 2 = 50 dollars. Her parents gave her 15 dollars, and her grandparents gave her 15 x 2 = 30 dollars. In total, that's 15 + 30 = 45 dollars. So she still needs 100 - 45 = 55. The answer is 55.

[Ground-truth Solution]
Betty has half of the 100 dollars, which is 100/2 = 50. Her parents will give 15 dollars. Her grandparents will give twice as much as her parents, which is 15 x 2 = 30. So in total, Betty gets 50 + 15 + 30 = 95 dollars. However, to find out how much more she needs, we subtract this total from the cost of the wallet: 100 - 95 = 5.

Betty needed $100 for the wallet. She already has half of that, which is 100 / 2 = 50 dollars. Her parents gave her 15 dollars, and her grandparents gave her 15 \times 2 = 30 dollars.

So far, we calculated 15 + 30 = 45, but wait, maybe thereâ€™s something wrong. We forgot to include the amount Betty already had in the total. Let's rethink this.

Betty has half of the 100 dollars, which is 100/2 = 50. Her parents will give 15 dollars. Her grandparents will give twice as much as her parents, which is 15 x 2 = 30. So in total, Betty gets 50 + 15 + 30 = 95 dollars. However, to find out how much more she needs, we subtract this total from the cost of the wallet: 100 - 95 = 5. The answer is 5.

### Example 2

[Question]
Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden? Please also give your final number in the format of 'The answer is [your answer]'

[Previous Attempt]

There are ten yellow flowers. 80% more red means 10 + 0.8 * 10 = 18 red flowers. 25% as many green, compared to red and yellow, is 25% of (10 + 18) = 6.25, but in flowers we can't have half a flower, so we round it to 6 green flowers. Mark has 10 + 18 + 6 = 34 flowers in his garden.
The answer is 34.

[Ground-truth Solution]
There are 10 yellow flowers. There are 80% more purple flowers than yellow. 80% of 10 is 8. So purple flowers are 10 + 8 = 18. There are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. 25% of 28 (10 + 18) is 7. So there are 7 green flowers. 10 + 18 + 7 = 35. The answer is 35.

There are ten yellow flowers. 80% more red means 10 + 0.8 * 10 = 18 red flowers. 25% as many green, compared to red and yellow, is 25% of (10 + 18) = 6.25, but in flowers we can't have half a flower, so we round it to 6 green flowers.

Wait, maybe there's something wrong. Actually, 25% of (10 + 18) = 7. So there are 7 green flowers. Mark has 10 + 18 + 7 = 35 flowers in his garden. The answer is 35.

### Example 3

[Question]
James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year? Please also give your final number in the format of 'The answer is [your answer]'

[Previous Attempt]
James writes 3 pages each time. He writes 2 times a week. So he writes 3 * 2 = 6 pages each week. He writes such for 52 weeks. So he write 6 * 52 weeks. 6 * 52 is 312. The answer is 312.

[Ground-truth Solution]
A year has 52 weeks. And James writes to two different friends twice a week. So he writes 2 * 2 = 4 letters a week. That gives him 4 * 52 = 208 letters in a year. 208 letters is 208 * 3 = 624 pages. The answer is 624.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Actually, James writes to two different friends twice a week, which means he writes 2 * 2 = 4 letters a week. That gives him 4 * 52 = 208 letters in a year. Since each letter is 3 pages, he writes 208 * 3 = 624 pages. The answer is 624.
