#### Example 1

[Question]
The bottoms of two vertical poles are 12 feet apart and are on a region of flat ground. One pole is 6 feet tall and the other is 15 feet tall. How long, in feet, is a wire stretched from the top of one pole to the top of the other pole?

[Previous Attempt]
Let's think step by step
Suppose that $O S = 6$ and $P T = 15,$ and let $S$ and $T$ be the bottoms of the poles.
Let the wire cross $S T$ at $Q$.
By similar triangles, we have \[\frac{S Q}{6} = \frac{Q T}{15},\]so $S Q = \frac{6 Q T}{15}.$
Then $Q T = 12 - S Q = 12 - \frac{6 Q T}{15},$ so $Q T = \frac{15}{3} = \boxed{5}.$
The answer is 5

[Ground-truth Solution]
Picturing the situation, we have a trapezoid with the two poles as bases. We can split this trapezoid into a rectangle at the bottom and a right triangle at the top, where the hypotenuse of the right triangle is the wire stretched from the top of one pole to the top of the other pole.

The horizontal leg of the right triangle is 12 feet, the horizontal distance from one pole to the other. The vertical leg of the triangle is $15-6=9$ feet, the height difference of the poles. By the Pythagorean Theorem $a^2+b^2=c^2$, we can solve for the length of the hypotenuse. We get $c=\sqrt{144+81}=\sqrt{225}=15$. So the wire is $\boxed{15}$ feet long.

Alternatively, instead of using the Pythagorean Theorem, we notice that 9-12-$c$ has the same ratios as the 3-4-5 right triangle. So $c=3\cdot5=\boxed{15}$.
The answer is 15

Let the wire cross $S T$ at $Q$.
By similar triangles, we have \[\frac{S Q}{6} = \frac{Q T}{15},\]so $S Q = \frac{6 Q T}{15}.$
Then $Q T = 12 - S Q = 12 - \frac{6 Q T}{15}$
Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The problem asks for the length of the wire stretched from the top of one pole to the top of the other pole, not the distance QT. Let's rethink this.
The wire stretched between the tops of the poles forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The horizontal distance between the poles is 12 feet, and the vertical distance is the height difference of 15 - 6 = 9 feet.

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we calculate:
\[
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{12^2 + 9^2} = \sqrt{144 + 81} = \sqrt{225} = 15.
\]
Thus, the length of the wire is $ \boxed{15} $ feet.
The answer is 15

#### Example 2

[Question]
A set contains four numbers. The six pairwise sums of distinct elements of the set, in no particular order, are $189$, $320$, $287$, $234$, $x$, and $y$. Find the greatest possible value of $x+y$.

[Previous Attempt]
Let's think step by step
Let the numbers be $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$
Let the six sums be $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ $234,$ $x,$ and $y.$
Without loss of generality, assume $a > b > c > d.$
Then the largest sum is $a + b = 320$ and the second largest sum is $a + c = 287.$
Then the third largest sum is $b + c = 234.$
The sum of all six sums is $(a + b) + (a + c) + (b + c) + (a + d) + (b + d) + (c + d) = 3(a + b + c + d).$
Also, $x + y = (a + d) + (c + d) = 2d + (a + c).$
We want to maximize $x + y,$ so we want to maximize $d$ (subject to conditions).
Hence, the largest two sums, $320$ and $287,$ must be $a + b$ and $b + c.$
Then $a + c = 234,$ so $b = 320 - a$ and $c = 234 - a.$
Thus, $b + c = a + 94 = 287,$ so $a = 193.$
Now, $b = 320 - 193 = 127$ and $c = 234 - 193 = 41,$
so $d = 234 - b - c = 234 - 127 - 41 = 66.$
Then $x + y = 2d + (a + c) = 2 \cdot 66 + 234 = \boxed{366}.$
The answer is 366

[Ground-truth Solution]
For such a set $\{a, b, c, d\},$ the six pairwise sums can be themselves paired up into three pairs which all have the same sum: \[\begin{aligned} a+b\; &\text{ with } \;c+d, \\  a+c\; &\text{ with }\; b+d, \\  a+d \;&\text{ with } \;b+c. \end{aligned}\]Thus, the sum of all six pairwise sums is $3S,$ where $S = a+b+c+d,$ and so in our case, \[x+y=3S - (189 + 320 + 287 + 234) = 3S - 1030.\]Therefore, we want to maximize $S.$

Because of the pairing of the six pairwise sums, $S$ must be the sum of two of the four given numbers $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ and $234,$ so the greatest possible value of $S$ is $320 + 287 = 607.$ Therefore, the greatest possible value of $x+y$ is $3(607) - 1030 = 791.$ This value is achievable for the set $\{51.5, 137.5, 182.5, 235.5\},$ which has pairwise sums $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ $234,$ $373,$ and $418.$ Therefore the answer is $\boxed{791}.$
The answer is 791

[Connected Solution] (Output the connected solution only. Do NOT output any other things.)
Let's think step by step
Let the numbers be $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$
Let the six sums be $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ $234,$ $x,$ and $y.$
Without loss of generality, assume $a > b > c > d.$
Then the largest sum is $a + b = 320$ and the second largest sum is $a + c = 287.$
Then the third largest sum is $b + c = 234.$
The sum of all six sums is $(a + b) + (a + c) + (b + c) + (a + d) + (b + d) + (c + d) = 3(a + b + c + d).$
Also, $x + y = (a + d) + (c + d) = 2d + (a + c).$
We want to maximize $x + y,$ so we want to maximize $d$ (subject to conditions).
Hence, the largest two sums, $320$ and $287,$ must be $a + b$ and $b + c.$
Wait, letâ€™s pause and consider what we know so far. The problem setup indicates that the six sums pair into three pairs, all of which sum to the same value $ 2(a + b + c + d). $ This suggests a symmetry in the sums that wasn't accounted for earlier. Let's reconsider.

By pairing the sums as $ (a + b) $ with $ (c + d), $ $ (a + c) $ with $ (b + d), $ and $ (a + d) $ with $ (b + c), $ we have
\[
x + y = 3(a + b + c + d) - (189 + 320 + 287 + 234).
\]
Thus, $ x + y = 3S - 1030, $ where $ S = a + b + c + d. $ To maximize $ x + y, $ we maximize $ S. $
The largest possible $ S $ comes from summing the two largest numbers among $ 189, 320, 287, $ and $ 234. $ Thus, $ S = 320 + 287 = 607. $
Substituting,
\[
x + y = 3(607) - 1030 = 1821 - 1030 = 791.
\]
This value is achievable with a set that matches the required pairwise sums.
The answer is $ \boxed{791} $
