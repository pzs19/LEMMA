#### Example 1

[Question]
Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel? Please also give your final number in the format of 'The answer is [your answer]'.

[Previous Attempt]
Tobias spends $95 on shoes. He has $15 left. So he had 95 + 15 = $110 before buying the shoes. He saves $5 a month for the past 3 months. So he has 3 * 5 = $15. He earns $15 * 4 for mowing 4 lawns. Let x be the number of driveways he shovels. Then he earns 7x dollars shoveling. His total income is the sum of mowing lawns, shoveling driveways and his savings. So we can write the equation:
15 + 7x = 110
Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:
7x = 95
Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
x = 13.57
Since the number of driveways must be a whole number, we round down to get x = 13. The answer is 13.

[Ground-truth Solution]
He saved up $110 total because 95 + 15 = <<95+15=110>>110
He saved $15 from his allowance because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15
He earned $60 mowing lawns because 4 x 15 = <<4*15=60>>60
He earned $35 shoveling driveways because 110 - 60 - 15 = <<110-60-15=35>>35
He shoveled 5 driveways because 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5
The answer is 5

Tobias spends $95 on shoes and has $15 left, so he had 95 + 15 = $110 before buying the shoes. He saves $5 a month for the past 3 months, so he has 3 times 5 = $15 from his allowance. He earns $15 per lawn and mows 4 lawns, so he earns 15 times 4 = $60 from mowing lawns. Let x be the number of driveways he shovels. Then he earns 7x dollars shoveling driveways. His total income is the sum of his allowance, mowing lawns, and shoveling driveways. So we can write the equation:
15 + 7x = 110
Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The equation 15 + 7x = 110 doesn't seem to account for the $60 earned from mowing lawns. Let's correct this. The correct equation should be:
15 + 60 + 7x = 110
Simplifying, we get:
75 + 7x = 110
Subtracting 75 from both sides, we get:
7x = 35
Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
x = 5
The answer is 5

#### Example 2

[Question]
In a 50-question test with two marks for each question, Meghan learned that she scored 20 marks less than her friend Jose, who scored 40 more marks than their friend Alisson. Calculate the total score for the three in the test combined if Jose got 5 questions wrong? Please also give your final number in the format of 'The answer is [your answer]'.

[Previous Attempt]
Jose got 5 questions wrong. The test has 50 questions. So he got 50 - 5 = 45 questions right. He got 40 more marks than Alisson. So Alisson got 45 - 40 = 5 questions right. And she scored 20 marks less than Jose, so she got 45 - 20 = 25 questions right. For each question, she got 2 marks. So she got 25 * 2 = 50 marks. Jose got 45 questions right. So he got 45 * 2 = 90 marks. Alisson got 5 questions right. So she got 5 * 2 = 10 marks. Combined their scores is 10 + 50 + 90 = 150. The answer is 150.

[Ground-truth Solution]
If you answer every question correctly in the test, the total possible marks are 50*2= <<50*2=100>>100 marks.
If Jose got five questions wrong, he lost 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 marks because each question has two marks.
Therefore, Jose scored 100-10 = <<100-10=90>>90 marks on the test.
Meghan scored 20 marks less than that which Jose got, a total of 90-20 = <<90-20=70>>70 marks.
The total marks that Jose and Meghan scored in the test are 70+90 = <<70+90=160>>160
Alisson scored 90-40 = <<90-40=50>>50 marks in the examination, 40 marks less than that which Jose scored on the test.
The total number of marks that the three scored in the test is 160+50 = <<160+50=210>>210
The answer is 210

[Connected Solution] (Output the connected solution only. Do NOT output any other things.)
Jose got 5 questions wrong. The test has 50 questions. So he got 50 - 5 = 45 questions right. He got 40 more marks than Alisson. So Alisson got 45 - 40 = 5 questions right. Wait, maybe there's something wrong. The statement "Jose got 40 more marks than Alisson" refers to marks, not the number of questions. As it is a 50-question test, the total marks is 50 * 2 = 100, so each question is worth 2 marks. Letâ€™s pause and reconsider.
Jose scored 45 x 2 = 90 marks. Since Jose scored 40 more marks than Alisson, Alisson must have scored 90 - 40 = 50 marks. Meghan scored 20 marks less than Jose, so she scored 90 - 20 = 70 marks.
Now, we can calculate the total score for the three: Jose scored 90 marks, Alisson scored 50 marks and Meghan scored 70 marks. Combined their scores is 90 + 50 + 70 = 210. The answer is 210
