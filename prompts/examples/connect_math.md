#### Example 1

[Question]
Twenty gremlins and fifteen imps are at the Annual Mischief Convention. The imps have had a lot of in-fighting lately and refuse to shake hands with each other, but they readily shake hands with all of the gremlins. Meanwhile, all the gremlins are quite friendly and shake hands with all of the other gremlins as well as imps. Each pair of creatures shakes hands at most once. How many handshakes were at the convention? Please also give your final number in the format of '\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $your answer$. I hope it is correct.'

[Previous Attempt]
Let's think step by step
There are a total of $20+15=35$ creatures at the convention.
Every creature shakes hands with every other creature
except for the imps.
Therefore, the number of handshakes at the convention
is equivalent to the number of ways to choose two of the $35$ creatures,
which is $\binom{35}{2}=\boxed{595}$.
The answer is 595

[Ground-truth Solution]
Let's think step by step
The number of handshakes is equal to the number of unordered pairs whose members are of different species.
There are ${20 \choose 2} = 190$ unordered pairs of gremlins,
and ${20 \choose 1} {15 \choose 1} = 300$ unordered pairs consisting of a gremlin
and an imp.
Adding these together, we get $190 + 300 = \boxed{490}$ handshakes.
The answer is 490

Let's think step by step.

Therefore, the number of handshakes at the convention is equivalent to the number of ways to choose two of the $35$ creatures, which is $\binom{35}{2} = \boxed{595}$.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The imps refuse to shake hands with each other, so the calculation $\binom{35}{2}$ includes handshakes that don't actually happen. Let's rethink this.

The number of handshakes is equal to the number of unordered pairs whose members are of different species.
There are ${20 \choose 2} = 190$ unordered pairs of gremlins,
and ${20 \choose 1} {15 \choose 1} = 300$ unordered pairs consisting of a gremlin
and an imp.
Adding these together, we get $190 + 300 = \boxed{490}$ handshakes. The answer is $\boxed{490}$

#### Example 2

[Question]
What is the area, in square units, of triangle $ABC$ in the figure shown if points $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ are coplanar, angle $D$ is a right angle, $AC = 13$, $AB = 15$ and $DC = 5$? Please also give your final number in the format of '\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $your answer$. I hope it is correct.'

[Previous Attempt]
Let's think step by step
Since $AD + DC = 12 + 5 = 17 = AC$,
we conclude that $\triangle ADC$ is a right triangle.
Thus, $AD = 9$ by the Pythagorean Theorem.
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $BD = 3$,
so the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{(AB)(BD)}{2} = \frac{15 \cdot 3}{2} = 22.5$.
The answer is 22.5

[Ground-truth Solution]
Seeing that triangle $ACD$ is a 5-12-13 right triangle, $AD=12$. Then using Pythagorean Theorem, we can calculate $BD$ to be $BD=\sqrt{15^2-12^2}=\sqrt{3^2(5^2-4^2)}=3\sqrt{25-16}=3\sqrt{9}=3 \cdot 3 = 9$. Thus, the area of triangle $ABD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 \cdot 9=6 \cdot 9=54 \text{sq units}$ and the area of triangle $ACD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 \cdot 5=6 \cdot 5=30 \text{sq units}$. The area of triangle $ABC$ is the difference between the two areas: $54 \text{sq units} - 30 \text{sq units} = \boxed{24} \text{sq units}$.
The answer is 24
