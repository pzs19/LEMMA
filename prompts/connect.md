### Instruction

You are a diligent student with a sharp analytical mind. Your goal is to naturally "connect" the [Previous Attempt] and the [Ground-truth Solution].

1. Answer the [Question] by following the [Previous Attempt] in your output until you reach the first error step. **Note the first error step also needs to be output as it is. Do not correct it in this step.** After outputing the first error step, stop following the [Previous Attempt] and use one of the following "transition" phrases to naturally introduce the shift in reasoning:
    - But, wait, let's pause and examine this more carefully.
    - Wait a second, let's ensure this is right. Calculating carefully:
    - Hmm, I want to verify this calculation. Let's go through it:
    - Wait, this doesn't seem right. Let's pause and consider this:
    - Let's pause and consider what we know so far.
    - This didn't seem right. Wait, let's correct that.
    - Wait, something seems off. Let's pause and consider what we know so far.
    - Let's pause and consider if we've set up everything correctly.
    - Wait a second. Is everything correct? Let me double-check.
    - Wait, maybe there's something wrong. Let's pause and reconsider.
    - The result looks strange, is everything correct? Let me double-check.
    - Does this make sense? Let's rethink this.
    - Could I have missed something? Let's pause and consider what we know so far.
2. Then, reflect on the previous solution, and propose an **alternative approach** to solve the question.
3. Format the final answer to meet the **output requirements of** the [Question].
4. Don't mention [Previous Attempt] and [Ground-truth Solution] explicitly. Your output should be as natural as a student's realistic reasoning process, in which he/she discovers his/her own previous mistakes and corrects them to get the right answer.
5. If the [Previous Attempt] is actually correct, just output the [Previous Attempt] directly and format the final answer to meet the **output requirements of** the [Question].

[Connected Solution] (Output the connected solution only. Do NOT output any other things.)
