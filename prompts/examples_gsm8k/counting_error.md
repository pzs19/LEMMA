#### Example 1

[Question]
Manny had 3 birthday cookie pies to share with his 24 classmates and his teacher, Mr. Keith.   If each of the cookie pies were cut into 10 slices and Manny, his classmates, and Mr. Keith all had 1 piece, how many slices are left?

[Ground-truth Solution]
There is a total of 3 x 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cookie slices.
There are 24 + 1 + 1 = <<24+1+1=26>>26 people who ate the cookie pieces.
There is 30 - 26 = <<30-26=4>>4 cookie slices left.
The answer is: 4

[Error-Injected Solution]
3 pies with 10 slices each is 10 x 3 = 30 slices. If Manny, his 24 classmates, and Mr. Keith all had one piece then that is 25 pieces. 30 - 25 is 5. There are 5 slices left. The answer is: 5
<explanation>The error in this solution is a 'counting_error'. The number of people who ate the cookie pieces was miscalculated. The proposed solution counts 25 people (Manny, 24 classmates, and Mr. Keith), but the correct number is 26 (Manny, 24 classmates, and Mr. Keith). </explanation>

#### Example 2

[Question]
Jim collects model cars, and he has 301 models total.  Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords, and 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys.  How many Buicks does Jim have?

[Ground-truth Solution]
Let x represent the number of Chevys
Fords:3+2x
Buicks:4(3+2x)=12+8x
Total:x+3+2x+12+8x=301
11x+15=301
11x=286
x=<<26=26>>26
Buicks:12+8(26)=220
The answer is: 220

[Error-Injected Solution]
Let the number of Chevys be C. Then the number of Fords is 2C + 3. The number of Buicks is 4 * (2C + 3). The total number of models is 301. So we have the equation: C + (2C + 3) + 4 * (2C + 3) = 301. Solving this equation, we find C = 10. So the number of Fords is 2 * 10 + 3 = 23. And the number of Buicks is 4 * 23 = 92. The answer is: 92
<explanation>The error in this solution is a 'counting_error'. When calculating the total number of cars, the solution incorrectly counted the number of Fords as 2C + 3 and Buicks as 4(2C + 3) but misinterpreted the relationship between the variables. Specifically, the number of Chevys (C) should have been properly incorporated into the total equation using the given relationships. This counting error led to an incorrect value of C, which propagated through the calculations, resulting in an incorrect answer of 92 instead of the correct answer, 220.</explanation>
