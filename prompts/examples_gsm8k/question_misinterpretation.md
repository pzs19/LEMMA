#### Example 1

[Question]
There are 70 cookies in a jar. If there are only 28 cookies left after a week, and Paul took out the same amount each day, how many cookies did he take out in four days?

[Ground-truth Solution]
Paul took out a total of 70-28 = <<70-28=42>>42 cookies in a week.
Paul took out 42/7 = <<42/7=6>>6 cookies out of the jar each day.
Over four days, Paul took out 6*4 = <<6*4=24>>24 cookies from the jar.
The answer is: 24

[Error-Injected Solution]
There were originally 70 cookies. Now there are only 28. So 70 - 28 = 42 were taken out. Paul took out an equal amount of cookies each day for 4 days. So he took out 42 / 4 = 10.5 cookies each day. The answer is: 10.5.
<explanation>The error in this solution is a 'question_misinterpretation'. The problem states that Paul took out the **same amount each day**, and the total number of cookies taken out over a week (7 days) is 42. However, the solution incorrectly divides the total cookies (42) by 4 days instead of 7 days, leading to a misinterpretation of the daily cookie consumption. </explanation>

#### Example 2

[Question]
Liz sold her car at 80% of what she originally paid. She uses the proceeds of that sale and needs only $4,000 to buy herself a new $30,000 car. How much cheaper is her new car versus what she originally paid for her old one?

[Ground-truth Solution]
If Liz needs only $4,000 to buy a new $30,000 car, that means she has $30,000-$4,000=$<<30000-4000=26000>>26,000 from the proceeds of selling her old car
If she sold her car at 80% of what she originally paid for and sold it for $26,000 then she originally paid $26,000/80% = $32,500 for her old car
If she paid $32,500 for her old car and the new one is $30,000 then, the new one is $32,500-$30,000 = $<<32500-30000=2500>>2,500 cheaper
The answer is: 2500

[Error-Injected Solution]
Liz sold her car at 80% of its original price. So if the original price was 100%, then she got 80% of that. That is 80% of $30,000, which is 0.8 x 30000 = 24000 dollars. Then she needs only $4,000 more to get the full $30,000. So that extra money comes from the 20% that she did not get from the sale. 20% of $30,000 is 0.2 x 30000 = 6000 dollars. The new car was 100% of $30,000 and the old car was 80% of $30,000. So the new car is 100% - 80% = 20% cheaper than the old one. 20% of $30,000 is 6000 dollars. The answer is: 6000.
<explanation>The error in this solution is a 'question_misinterpretation'. The first wrong step arises because the proposed solution incorrectly assumes that the $30,000 price of the new car is the original price of the old car, leading to the incorrect calculation of the sale price of the old car as 80% of $30,000. The correct approach should be to determine the original price of the old car based on the sale price and the 80% ratio. </explanation>

#### Example 3

[Question]
Paul's grades last semester were very bad. To encourage him, Paul's dad promised him $5 for every B+ he gets in his next scorecard and twice that amount for every A. If Paul obtains at least two A+ he'll double the previous rewards and would receive a flat $15 for every A+ obtained (with no extra bonus). If there are 10 courses with grades in Paul's scorecard, what's the maximum amount he could receive from his dad?

[Ground-truth Solution]
We know Paul would get $5 for a B+. However, we know this could be (2x) doubled if he obtains at least two A+. This means 2*$5 = $<<2*5=10>>10 for a B+ if Paul gets at least two A+
We know Paul would get twice the reward of a B+ if he gets an A. This means 2*$5 = $<<5*2=10>>10 for every A
However, we know his reward for every A could be (2x) doubled if he obtains at least two A+. This means 2*$10 = $<<2*10=20>>20 for every A if Paul gets at least two A+
We learn here then that Paul will get a higher reward for obtaining A grades ($20) than getting A+ grades ($15) as long as he's able to score at least two A+.
To maximize his payout, Paul will need to get only (2) two A+ from his 10 courses. Therefore he should aim to get an A in the remaining 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 courses
Assuming Paul can get two A+ and eight A in his next scorecard his total payout would be 2*$15 + 8*$20
This translates into $30 + $160 or $<<30+160=190>>190
The answer is: 190

[Error-Injected Solution]
Paul's dad promised $5 for every B+ and twice that amount ($10) for every A. Additionally, if Paul obtains at least two A+, his previous rewards are doubled, and he receives a flat $15 for every A+ with no additional bonus. To maximize his payout, Paul should aim to maximize the grades that give the highest reward.

To maximize his payout, Paul should focus on getting as many A+ as possible because an A+ gives a flat $15, which is higher than the $10 reward for an A. Since there are 10 courses, Paul can aim to get 10 A+ grades.

If Paul gets 10 A+, his payout will be 10 * $15 = $150. The answer is: 150.

<explanation>The error in this solution is a 'question_misinterpretation'. The solution incorrectly assumes that maximizing the number of A+ grades will yield the highest reward. However, the problem specifies that obtaining at least two A+ will double the rewards for B+ and A grades, making the reward for A grades ($20) higher than the flat $15 for an A+. The correct strategy is to aim for only two A+ grades and maximize the number of A grades to maximize the total payout. </explanation>
